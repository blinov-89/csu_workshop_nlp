# Fine-tuning a model on a token classification task

In this notebook, we will see how to fine-tune one of the [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) model to a token classification task, which is the task of predicting a label for each token.

![Widget inference representing the NER task](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/images/token_classification.png?raw=1)

The most common token classification tasks are:

- NER (Named-entity recognition) Classify the entities in the text (person, organization, location...).
- POS (Part-of-speech tagging) Grammatically classify the tokens (noun, verb, adjective...)
- Chunk (Chunking) Grammatically classify the tokens and group them into "chunks" that go together

We will see how to easily load a dataset for these kinds of tasks and use the `Trainer` API to fine-tune a model on it.

This notebook is built to run on any token classification task, with any model checkpoint from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) as long as that model has a version with a token classification head and a fast tokenizer (check on [this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#bigtable) if this is the case). It might just need some small adjustments if you decide to use a different dataset than the one used here. Depending on you model and the GPU you are using, you might need to adjust the batch size to avoid out-of-memory errors. Set those three parameters, then the rest of the notebook should run smoothly:
"""

task = "ner" # Should be one of "ner", "pos" or "chunk"
model_checkpoint = "DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased-sentence"
batch_size = 16

"""## Loading the dataset

We will use the [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library to download the data and get the metric we need to use for evaluation (to compare our model to the benchmark). This can be easily done with the functions `load_dataset` and `load_metric`.
"""

from datasets import load_dataset, load_metric

"""For our example here, we'll use the [CONLL 2003 dataset](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W03-0419.pdf). The notebook should work with any token classification dataset provided by the ðŸ¤— Datasets library. If you're using your own dataset defined from a JSON or csv file (see the [Datasets documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading_datasets.html#from-local-files) on how to load them), it might need some adjustments in the names of the columns used."""

datasets = load_dataset("surdan/nerel_short")

"""We can see the training, validation and test sets all have a column for the tokens (the input texts split into words) and one column of labels for each kind of task we introduced before.

To access an actual element, you need to select a split first, then give an index:
"""

datasets["train"][0]

"""The labels are already coded as integer ids to be easily usable by our model, but the correspondence with the actual categories is stored in the `features` of the dataset:"""

datasets["train"].features[f"ids"]

"""So for the NER tags, 0 corresponds to 'O', 1 to 'B-PER' etc... On top of the 'O' (which means no special entity), there are four labels for NER here, each prefixed with 'B-' (for beginning) or 'I-' (for intermediate), that indicate if the token is the first one for the current group with the label or not:
- 'PER' for person
- 'ORG' for organization
- 'LOC' for location
- 'MISC' for miscellaneous

"""## Preprocessing the data

Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them. This is done by a ðŸ¤— Transformers `Tokenizer` which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.

To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` method, which will ensure:

- we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,
- we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.

That vocabulary will be cached, so it's not downloaded again the next time we run the cell.

tokenized_datasets = datasets.map(tokenize_and_align_labels, batched=True)

"""Even better, the results are automatically cached by the ðŸ¤— Datasets library to avoid spending time on this step the next time you run your notebook. The ðŸ¤— Datasets library is normally smart enough to detect when the function you pass to map has changed (and thus requires to not use the cache data). For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the first cell and rerun the notebook. ðŸ¤— Datasets warns you when it uses cached files, you can pass `load_from_cache_file=False` in the call to `map` to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.

Note that we passed `batched=True` to encode the texts by batches together. This is to leverage the full benefit of the fast tokenizer we loaded earlier, which will use multi-threading to treat the texts in a batch concurrently.

## Fine-tuning the model

Now that our data is ready, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it. Since all our tasks are about token classification, we use the `AutoModelForTokenClassification` class. Like with the tokenizer, the `from_pretrained` method will download and cache the model for us. The only thing we have to specify is the number of labels for our problem (which we can get from the features, as seen before):
"""

from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer

model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, num_labels=len(label_list))

"""The warning is telling us we are throwing away some weights (the `vocab_transform` and `vocab_layer_norm` layers) and randomly initializing some other (the `pre_classifier` and `classifier` layers). This is absolutely normal in this case, because we are removing the head used to pretrain the model on a masked language modeling objective and replacing it with a new head for which we don't have pretrained weights, so the library warns us we should fine-tune this model before using it for inference, which is exactly what we are going to do.

To instantiate a `Trainer`, we will need to define three more things. The most important is the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.TrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training. It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model, and all other arguments are optional:
"""

model_name = model_checkpoint.split("/")[-1]
args = TrainingArguments(
    f"{model_name}-finetuned-{task}",
    evaluation_strategy = "epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,
    num_train_epochs=15,
    weight_decay=0.01
    # push_to_hub=True,
)

"""Here we set the evaluation to be done at the end of each epoch, tweak the learning rate, use the `batch_size` defined at the top of the notebook and customize the number of epochs for training, as well as the weight decay.

The last argument to setup everything so we can push the model to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) regularly during training. Remove it if you didn't follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook. If you want to save your model locally in a name that is different than the name of the repository it will be pushed, or if you want to push your model under an organization and not your name space, use the `hub_model_id` argument to set the repo name (it needs to be the full name, including your namespace: for instance `"sgugger/bert-finetuned-ner"` or `"huggingface/bert-finetuned-ner"`).

Then we will need a data collator that will batch our processed examples together while applying padding to make them all the same size (each pad will be padded to the length of its longest example). There is a data collator for this task in the Transformers library, that not only pads the inputs, but also the labels:
"""

from transformers import DataCollatorForTokenClassification

data_collator = DataCollatorForTokenClassification(tokenizer)

"""The last thing to define for our `Trainer` is how to compute the metrics from the predictions. Here we will load the [`seqeval`](https://github.com/chakki-works/seqeval) metric (which is commonly used to evaluate results on the CONLL dataset) via the Datasets library."""

metric = load_metric("seqeval")

"""This metric takes list of labels for the predictions and references:"""

labels = [label_list[i] for i in example[f"ids"]]
metric.compute(predictions=[labels], references=[labels])

"""So we will need to do a bit of post-processing on our predictions:
- select the predicted index (with the maximum logit) for each token
